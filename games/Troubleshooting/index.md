Are you having trouble playing some of our applet games in browser? You came to the right place.

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
Basically only Internet Explorer, 32-bit Firefox, and Safari support Java. Browers need NPAPI support to run our applets.

<h2>Chrome</h2>
Chances are you're tyring to play a java applet. Unfortunately Chrome removed support for Applets in update 45. I reccomend you try revisiting the page in Internet Explorer.

<h2>Internet Explorer</h2>
First off make sure you have Java installed. Check if there is a "Java was blocked" bar at the bottom of your screen. Hit "Run this time", then choose the "Later" button from the new popup. 
You will then likely need to click "Run" again since our jars are currently unsigned. You may at some point need to press the Windows button, type in "Java", and click "Configure Java". Then 
click the "Security" tab and add our website, teancode.github.io, to the exception list at the bottom.

<h2>Mozilla Firefox</h2>
In more recent versions of Firefox only 32-bit versions support Java, but support is likely going to be dropped sometime in 2016.

<h2>Safari</h2>
According to the internet Safari supports java. The instructions would likely be similar to IE.

<h2>Edge(Spartan)</h2>
Nope. Thanks Microsoft.
