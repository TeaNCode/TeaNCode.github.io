Our free to play game, Defenders of Space is coming along nicely. It it's current state it isn't much more than a Space Invaders clone with a Galaga coat of paint.
We plan on making it a game of it's own, with an upgrades store, multiple levels, and powerups.

It is functioning in it's current form and has support for 1 or 2 players. You can see the repository [here](https://github.com/TeaNCode/Defender-of-Space).
We do plan on uploading a playable applet to the website.
